What is the advantage and disadvantage of BinarySearchTree over HashTable data structures.


A balanced Binary Tree can be guaranteed to work in O(log n) and can have keys sorted with traversals. Implementation of BinarySearchTree is easier than hashing. There is not guarantee but a HashTable can have its operating running close to O(1) constant time. Sometimes HashTable would be preferred for unsorted conditions or if the input size is known.
