What is the advantage and disadvantage of Linked List compared with Array-Based data structures?

The advantage of a Linked List is that adding and removing elements are constant time O(1) compared to Array-Based data structures and the size does not need to be specified.
The disadvantage is that it takes linear time O(n) to traverse through the list of a Linked List.
